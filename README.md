# Hardhat Project

WavePortal --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
